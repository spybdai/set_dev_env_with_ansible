# set_dev_env_with_ansible
Use Ansible to set up dev environment with common configs. 

We general keep a set of shell scripts to prepare the dev environment, especially when mgirate to a new dev laptop. And it's indeed troublesome. At least for me it is. 

So maybe can do this with Ansible? Yea, I know, it maybe somehow overhead, but who knows? Just have a try. 

We can take care of our dec pc as a server. Any update? Just put it into the playbooks (Newbee to Ansible, hope I am using item 'playbooks' correct) and push it to your repo. And, when your boss upgrade you with a new mac pro, you konw that...

So, why not?
